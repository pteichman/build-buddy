This is Build Buddy, the Ximian Build System.


DOCUMENTATION

There is a user's manual as well as some developer documentation in
the docs/ directory.  Most scripts also contain perldoc documentation
(run "perldoc scriptname").


BUILDING AND DEVELOPING

If you have never contributed to BB before, contact the maintainer for
instructions.  There will be some paperwork to be filled out.

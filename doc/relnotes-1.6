2. Overview of new features in Build Buddy 1.6
   -------------------------------------------

* Web UI cleanup

The Web UI now has a new look, and some content changes as well.

The job creation page has the ability to move modules to the
top/bottom of the build order in one click. In order to keep the
module commands to the right of each module short, they have been
abbreviated as well.  Their meanings are:

^: Move up
v: Move down
T: Move to the top
B: Move to the bottom
x: Delete

The job creation page's "edit" link to edit the global job settings
now displays a new page, instead of the in-line editing previously
used.  The settings, however, are the same (except for new fields to
access other new features in this release, such as mcookie/partnernet
deployment, shared jobs, etc).  This page now has checkboxes to select
the build targets.  The checkboxes reflect the current available
targets to build on.

The node info page displays some additional information, such as the
currently unpacked jails, their owner, and wether they are available
for use or not.

New users must provide an email field.  This email is used to report
snapshot status to the job owner.

* Snapshot reports

Snapshots now generate email reports *with job results*, if the
"email" logstyle for bb_snapshot is used.

Also, if the "rss" logstyle is used, an RSS feed can be generated,
which can be viewed with any RSS reader.  However, if the Build Buddy
server is behind a firewall, the RSS reader will need to be behind the
firewall as well.  Therefore, readers such as Bloglines will not work
with our internal server.

Multiple logstyles can now be used, by separating them with commas.
e.g., "bb_snapshot --logstyle email,rss".

* partnernet/mcookie deployment

partnernet and mcookie values can now be stored in the database and
set for each job.  This allows RCD to be configured without the need
to activate any keys.  In addition to speed, this means each new job
does not use a new seat on the server.

Do not share your mcookie or partnernet files, however.  If you do,
and someone else activates an additional key with that mcookie, your
jobs will suddenly "see" additional channels!

The mcookie/partnernet changes are also available as jail metadata.
At that level, the rcd.passwd and rcd.conf files can also be
configured.  It is possible, then, to not set the mcookie/partnernet
for each job, but to set it for each jail instead.  If both are set,
the job's are used.  Note, also, that the job will set the
mcookie/partnernet in the jail metadata.

* Shared jobs

Saved jobs can now be shared with other users.  These users will be
able to see and edit all of the job's values.  To share a job with
another user, load the saved job, go to "Shared Users", and write the
BB login names of each user.

* NFS riddance

Build Buddy can now fully function without the need to use NFS.  There
are several changes to be aware of:

Logging:  Logs are now reported back to the bb_logger daemon running
on the master, via XML-RPC.  The logger then writes the logs to disk,
much in the same way that they used to be written before.

Package/other files:  BB_ARCHIVEDIR (the place where packages and
other files get placed) is now set to a jail-local directory (in
/tmp).  Files get copied to the master throughout the build, via
rsync.

Repository access:  Since the repository is now remote, all jobs that
wish to access is must also set (in addition to BB_REPODIR) the
BB_REPOUSER variable.  This will cause BB to use bb_ssh to access the
repository.

* Multiple target submission

It is now trivial to build on one target and submit on any other
target(s).

To do this, go to the new job page, click on [Edit], and scroll down
to the "RC Submission" section.  Add the targets you wish to submit to
in the "Submit Targets" setting, separating them with commas.

Note that if you set Submit Targets and wish to submit to the current
target you're building on, you must set it explicitly.  If left unset,
it will default to the current target.

Please ensure your packages will work on the other target(s).  BB will
not perform any checks whatsoever to ensure that they will.  Usage of
this feature is only recommended then for targets that are guaranteed
to be binary compatible with each other.

* Tarball creation

Build Buddy can now create tarballs of the built packages.  Currently,
it can only do this from RPM packages.  BB merely extracts the payload
of the RPM package, so therefore the tarballs a) are laid out in the
same manner as the packages (one tarball per RPM), and b) contain
exactly the same files.

To use this feature, simply enable the checkbox from the new job page,
or if using bb_client, use the --create_tarballs option.

* Build process changes

The build script that runs for each job has seen some changes.  The
most important one is that BB will now skip the build for any packages
that are already installed in the jail at the same version that wuild
be built.  This means that if a build fails, it can be resubmitted to
use the same jail, and the build will continue about where it left off
(the failed module will be rebuilt from scratch).

The previous change is most useful when the newly added "Ignore
Submission Errors" setting (a checkbox on the new job page) is
enabled.  This causes the build to not fail, even if submission to red
carpet fails for any module.  The reason why it's useful is because
with the above change, it is more common that BB will attempt to
submit a module that has already been submitted previously.

Other changes are that on SUSE, the SuSEconfig program is run if Red
Carpet was run (because current Red Carpet builds don't run it for
us--future ones will), and also that BB attempts to build as the
"distro" user, instead of root.

* Script improvements

Various BB scripts have been improved.  The most useful ones are:

bb_do: macro_replace package names.
bb_jail_meta: Can now list the available metadata stores, as well as
              listing all the (simple) metadata in a store.
bb_get: Use bb_scp instead of scp.
bb_xmlgen: Add bz2 support.


3. Installing Build Buddy
   ----------------------

(TODO)


4. Upgrading an existing installation
   ----------------------------------

There is a new script called bb_schema_upgrade_1.6, to update an the
database of an existing installation to 1.6.

* Daemons

The bb_node daemon no longer has the --jail_delete_threshold option,
since it was cumbersome to use.  Instead, a simpler --maximum_jails
option is now provided.  The default is 10 open jails.  This means
that, whenever there are 10 or more open jails, BB will attempt to
clean up any unused jails.

Regardless of disk space, more than 10 jails is not recommended, as it
makes job submission too slow.

The bb_snapshot script is now the only snapshot script available.  The
bb_snapshotter script was merged into it.  Moreover, the --longsleep
option is now --loop, and it can be disabled with -1 (not 0).

* Configuration

The bb.conf file has been updated to include comments.  It also has
two new sections for bb_snapshot settings, as well as RSS settings
(for bb_snapshot's RSS logstyle).

bb.conf also has new settings for the Mason component root, and a
logger group that is used to set the gid that is used to write the
logs.  This setting is less important now, though, because the logs no
longer live on NFS.

It is now possible to configure the web UI to run via CGI.  There is a
sample Apache CGI handler and configuration file included in the web/
directory of the BB sources.  They have been tested with Apache 2.

The default locations for some things have changed.  For example, the
Mason component root (generally the same as Apache's document root)
now defaults to /srv/www/htdocs, and the outputdir (where logs and
packages end up) defaults to /srv/build-daemon on the master.

* Other

For those who build and install BB by hand, or make their own
packages, the Friend.make makefile supports three new environment
variables: HTDOCSDIR, CGIDIR, and APACHE_CONFDIR.


5. Known Issues
   ------------

There is not currently any way to change your email via the web UI.
Please contact your Build Buddy administrator, it can be changed in
the database manually.

Because of a problem with our XML-RPC libraries, some logs may contain
extra spaces.  Since the web UI displays logs in <pre> tags, they will
not be wrapped.  Therefore, if a line appears missing, be sure to try
to scroll to the right in case it was padded with spaces.

The bb_client script cannot configure RCD activations.  The only
workaround currently is to use the jail metadata to set mcookie and
partnernet files, so that jails are pre-activated.

The RSS feed generated by BB overwrites (instead of appending) the
last RSS file.  This means that under some readers, only the latest
snapshot will be visible.

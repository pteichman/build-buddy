2. New features in Build Buddy 1.4
   -------------------------------

* Jails

The biggest and most user-visible change in Build Buddy 1.4 are the
new jails.  Whereas 1.2 (and pre-1.2) jails consisted of a single tree
with a distribution's contents, 1.4 jails also contain jail metadata.
Moreover, several BB components are now aware of the metadata.
Notably, jail mounts, the RCD object, and the node itself make good
use of the new metadata.

It is now possible, for example, to request a build on a jail that
contains a particular bit of metadata (of your choosing).  There can
be multiple metadata xml files, and they are accesible via xpath
statements.

* Logging

The logging routines in BB are as big a change as the new jail
system, but not quite as user-visible.  BB is now much better at
logging both subcommands and internal routines.  Exceptions thrown
after the daemon forks off worker processes *do* get reported
properly.  This even includes jails not unpacking correctly--see the
"bb-node-log" logfile for messages from the node itself.

For those inclined to hack on BB, essentially all logging gets
channeled through a callback in Ximian::BB::Logger.  It would be
trivial to replace it with a callback that, instead of writing files
to disk, sends off logs to a database.

* NFS

We are closer to ditching the dependency on NFS.  In fact, with some
tweaking and a couple of caveats, it is possible to do so with 1.4.
However, we still are not quite ready to completely do away with it
for now.

There is no longer a dependency on the "/ximian" NFS mount.  The
functionality to install extra dependencies into the jail at job start
time is still there, but by default the directory is
"/nfs/release/extra-jail-deps".  In many cases, however, it is not
necessary to add packages to directories there--instead, it is
possible to create a new jail with the updated packages.  (Do remember
to increase the jail's version, in the main.xml metadata file, and to
set yourself as the jail's owner.)

At the API level, it is possible to change the extra jail deps
directory--allowing per-job settings, for example.  This is currently
not exposed in any clients (but may be in the future).

The package output and logging directories are still on nfs as
usual.  Logging may move off of nfs soon, packages will take a bit
longer to do so.

* Authentication and Authorization

The Build Buddy authentication and authorization routines have been
improved.  It is now possible to use two separate clients concurrently
(e.g., the webui and the bb_client command-line client).  In addition,
authorization can be tweaked via capabilities in the database.  The
default behavior for them is to allow an authenticated user to do
anything, which is the same behavior for 1.2.

* WebUI Improvements

The Web UI has seen some improvements, though they may require a
standards-compliant browser to view them.  The WebUI has been tested
with the Mozilla and Mozilla-based Camino web browsers.

* HTTP / FTP Transports

<source> tags can now point to http and ftp sources directly, without
the need to download them and keep them in the local repository.


3. Installing Build Buddy
   ----------------------

(TODO)


4. Upgrading an existing installation
   ----------------------------------

(TODO)


5. Known Issues
   ------------

* Some logs may be written after the job is marked as failed/succeeded.
The webui stops auto-refreshing after the job marked as such, so it is
a good idea to refresh manually if there appear to be logs missing.
There is a good test to find out whether the node still has logs to
write out:  Cick on the "bb-node-log" log (the first one), and scroll
to the bottom.  If it says "PID <nnn> exited with status <yyy>", then
it's done.  Otherwise, refresh again in a few seconds.

* The node's jail-less mode is not working at the moment.  We need to
create a new Jail class that derives from Jail::Dir (probably), but
actually just maps to the host system.  Some changes to Build.pm may
also be needed - but the idea is that it should require a jail object,
and check for specific jail features, instead of switching on
jail/no-jail.
